                    <p>Over the Summer I read Das Boot translated to English. This is a German book about a man's time in the German Navy on a U-boat during WW2. Lothar-Günther Buchheim wrote the book in 1973. The book is about one of the times he was out to sea on a German U-boat in the Atlantic. It talks about the U-boats, German Naval Strategy, and life on the U-boats through the author's experiences.</p>

                    <p>Over the Summer I did a lot of Biking to get to many places. At one point I had to replace my bike seat as I had broken the other one. The seat I went with was from the Company Schwinn. Schwinn was founded by Ignaz Schwinn, who was born in Hardheim, Baden, in Chicago.  The company was founded in 1895 and became the dominant manufacturer of Bikes in America. The Company went bankrupt in 1992 and became a sub-brand of Pacific Cycle.</p>

                    <p>When I went through my basement I found my Accordion that I got when I was a kid. I never really played it I just wanted it because it looked cool. The basic form of the Accordion is believed to have been invented by Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann in Berlin in 1822. The earliest known simple Accordions were made by Timofey Vorontsov in Tula, Russia in 1820 but this is poorly documented. The Accordion was introduced to many other countries by Germans throughout the years.</p>

                    <p>This is one of my dad's mugs that he showed me. His brother went over to Europe when he was in High School. When he was in Munich he picked up this mug for my Grandpa. When my Grandpa died in 1993 my Grandma gave it to my dad. Hofbräuhaus München is a bar in Munich, Germany.</p>

                    <img class="img" src="nor.png">
                    <p>Decisions in Normandy is a book about the Normandy invasion during WW2. The book goes over the planning of the Invasion, the invasion itself, and the Aftermath. Normandy is in France which has history the Germanic people the Franks. Normandy was under control of the Franks from 614 to 640 and later 674 to 676 and many other times because the Franks have broken apart almost as much as China has.  Normandy was also under British control from 1415 to 1451. The British are called Angelo-Saxons as the Germanic group the Saxons from Old Saxony invaded Britain, mostly Celts and Romans, and shifted the culture to a more Germanic one. So basically Normandy is German land and so is Britain and almost all of France.</p>

                    <p>Over the Summer I had to get new shoes. I went with some Adidas basketball shoes. Adidas is a German shoe company founded in 1949 in Herzogenaurach, Germany. It was founded by Adolf Dassler in his mom's house with his brother Rudolf in 1924. The original name was Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory. In 1949 the brothers had a falling out. Rudolf left to form Puma and Adolf created Adidas.</p>

                    <img class="img" src="sh5.png">
                    <p>For summer reading I read the book Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death by Kurt Vonnegut. This is an anti-war, Science fiction book that focuses mostly on the firebombing of Dresden in WW2. Kurt Vonnegut was an American soldier who fought the Nazi's. He was captured by them and later witnessed the firebombing of Dresden. On February 13th 1945 the USAAF and RAF began firebombing the German city of Dresden. The attack stopped on the 15th. The  strategic targets were destroyed and the city was reduced to rubble. It is said the people suffocated to death due to the lack of oxygen from the large fires. It is also stated that the fires were hot enough to form glass from sand and other materials. 22,700–25,000 people died.</p>
